Linear regression is not perfect for all data sets. Take Anscombe's quartet for example, where four completly different datasets have a line of best fit that looks exactly the same. 

A good way of determining whether or not, linear regression is a good predictive technique for the data set at hand, is to create a residual plot of the data and the calculated line of best fit. If the residual plot is random, then linear regression is adequate; if the residual plot follows a pattern of somesort, then a different regression method should be considered.
